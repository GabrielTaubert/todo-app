# ToDo App

This app is my first own GitHub project.  
With this project I want to learn the basics of software development and version control,
even though I already learned some concepts at university.

The usage of this app is a simple note application.  
In the end, the app should allow you to:
- add, edit, and delete notes
- save notes so that they persist after closing and restarting the app
- interact with a simple graphical user interface (GUI)

## Things I want to learn in this Project

- Learn how to set up a GitHub repository
- Set up a Java project from scratch
- Work with classes and objects
- Write and run Unit Tests
- Use the Git terminal
- Create a GUI
- Save and load data in JSON format

## Already implemented

- GitHub repository initialized
- Java file and package structure created
- First classes and Unit Tests implemented
